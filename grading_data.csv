"<blockquote><h3>Showing Gratitude</h3><h4>Part 1</h4>You work in a warehouse. While organizing inventory, you overhear a conversation between SrA Johnson> (your friend and coworker) and 1<sup>st</sup>Lt Franco> (your leader). At first, the conversation seems like normal business talk, but soon the tone changes. <ol><div style=""list-style-type:none"">SrA Johnson:> If I fail this review, then I don't get a promotion, and I'll be reassigned OCONUS. </div> <ol><div style=""list-style-type:none""> 1<sup>st</sup>Lt Franco:> I hear you, Johnson, but sometimes, it's not just about the work. There are... other ways to get ahead around here. You know what I mean? </div></ol> <div style=list-style-type:none>SrA Johnson:> No, what do you mean?</div><ol> <div style=""list-style-type:none""> 1<sup>st</sup>Lt Franco:> Listen, I've got influence around here. I can pull some strings to move you up the ranks, but you'd need to... show me some gratitude. This is just how things are done around here.</div></ol> <div style=list-style-type:none>SrA Johnson:> It sounds like you're suggesting…</div><ol> <div style=""list-style-type:none""> 1<sup>st</sup>Lt Franco (cuts him off):> Look, you're a smart guy, Johnson. I know what you want, and you know what I want. We can make an arrangement that helps us both get “a head”. </div></ol></ol>lockquote><h4>Part 2 - Scroll to continue reading</h4>You're still processing what you overheard. 1<sup>st</sup>Lt Franco's> offer about ""showing gratitude"" in exchange for a promotion seems coercive, but you're unsure whether to intervene. 1<sup>st</sup>Lt Franco> is influential within the team and a higher rank than you and SrA Johnson>. You're worried that saying something could cause serious professional consequences. <br><br>Even though SrA Johnson> is gay, 1<sup>st</sup>Lt Franco> is a total “ladies' man”, so it's hard to picture him asking SrA Johnson> for sexual favors. Plus, you were eavesdropping. Maybe you didn't hear things correctly?<br><br>There's also the issue of SrA Johnson's> role in all this. Maybe he doesn't feel pressured or coerced? After all, SrA Johnson> didn't speak up or reject 1<sup>st</sup>Lt Franco's> offer. Maybe SrA Johnson> is cool with it? Saying something to SrA Johnson> would be awkward if you're wrong, and you not even sure what you'd say. <br><br>Either way, this is definitely none of your business. Still, you can't shake the feeling that 1<sup>st</sup>Lt Franco's> behavior is crossing a line.    ","Active bystanders decide how to act in a risky situation based on what they know about a situation and the people involved. After reading part 2 of the scenario, identify two acceptable ways to respond in this situation.","Option 1: Confronting 1stLt Franco in front of Johnson, explaining the problems with what he's saying, even if he's just joking around. This shows that there is a witness to Franco's 'deal' and that Johnson isn't alone. 
Option 2: Talk to SrA Johnson privately, providing him advice and direction to report Franco via anonymous channels. ",Aggressive|Avoidant|Delay|Delegate|Direct|Distract|Document,,,,,Distract,
